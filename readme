Works like "xxd -i" but tries to create smaller file by omitting spaces and hex digits.

Examples:
$ th my_kitty_photo.png > kitty.h
	Generates header file with variables fileData and fileSize.
	
$ th < cat my_kitty_photo.png > kitty.h
	Reads data from STDIN.
	
$ th -v kitty my_kitty_photo.png > kitty.h
	Generates header file with kittyData and kittySize.
	
$ th -s -v kitty my_kitty_photo.png > kitty.h
	Generates header, but uses snake_case for veriables, that is kitty_data and kitty_size.
	
Refer to 'th --help' for more info.

TinyHead works also on empty files and generates empty array with size value of 0.

Compile it with make. You can then move it to ~/bin and add to PATH.

Program encodes bytes to ascii and bloats file roughtly 3 times.
This depends of the file, as 0x00 takes one character and 0xff takes three.

Compared to xxd is twice as effective (and a little faster).
